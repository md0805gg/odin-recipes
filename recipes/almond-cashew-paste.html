  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Cashew almond paste is used extensively in Indian cooking to help thicken gravies and give a rich texture to any curry. It adds a creamy texture and tasty twist to a variety of dishes.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>100g Cashews</li>
    <li>250ml Water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the cashews in a bowl and cover with water for 30-45 minutes</li>
    <li>Drain the cashews but keep some of the water to add back to the paste if required after blending</li>
    <li>Put the drained cashews into a dish suitable for blending and add just enough water to cover them by about 1 cm.</li>
    <li>Blend the cashews for about 20 seconds to create a paste adding back some of the drained liquid 1 tablespoon at a time (or water if you've thrown it) until you get a paste the consistency of yoghurt</li>
    <li>Store in the fridge for 3-5 days or freeze in 2 tbsp portions for use at a later date</li>
  </ol>
